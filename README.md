# yalai-iso
The build files used to create the YaLAI iso

Note that the *.desktop* file used for autorunning is missing here, and you can find it in the yalai-old repo.

## This iso is old and unmaintained. It is part of the now deprecated YaLAI V1-2 installer. You can find the current iso at [https://github.com/minigyima/yalai-iso]
